* Public-private key pairs are generated, exchanged, and validated for secure authentication
* Folder structures are created on both ICR and MFX systems for inbound and outbound files
* File encryption and decryption mechanisms (if applicable) are implemented as per agreed standards
* Automated file transfer scripts or jobs are configured and scheduled to meet business requirements
* End-to-end test transfers are successfully completed, ensuring seamless data flow between systems
* Exception handling and alerting mechanisms are in place for transfer failures or errors
* Documentation of the full setup, including a runbook and troubleshooting guide, is completed and stored in the project repository
