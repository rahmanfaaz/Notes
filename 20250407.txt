**Story Title:**
ICR\_NGC || Depositaries EMEA || Recreate the Prior Settled Cash Report in SSCD vs Legacy Custody

---

**Description:**
This story pertains to the meticulous reconstruction of the Prior Settled Cash Report within the ICR\_NGC platform, aligning it precisely with the standards and expectations of the SSCD system as compared to the existing Legacy Custody framework. The purpose of this enhancement is to ensure that the report generated within SSCD offers full functional parity, comprehensive data alignment, and superior accuracy relative to the legacy system, thereby upholding the highest standards of operational reporting and client confidence.

This initiative is critical to enable seamless reporting continuity, particularly as stakeholders transition their operational reliance from the legacy custody system to the modernised SSCD infrastructure.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

* Conduct a detailed analysis comparing the structure, logic, and data lineage of the Prior Settled Cash Report in the Legacy Custody system
* Design and implement the equivalent report within SSCD, ensuring that it captures all requisite data points and business rules
* Validate the accuracy, completeness, and formatting of the recreated report by conducting rigorous data reconciliations against the legacy version
* Ensure that the new SSCD report adheres to all applicable compliance, audit, and operational standards
* Perform comprehensive regression testing to confirm no adverse impact on adjacent reporting processes or downstream systems
* Engage key business stakeholders to review, validate, and formally sign off the recreated report’s outputs
* Finalise and deliver full supporting documentation, including technical specifications, functional mappings, and user guidance materials

**Comment upon Successful Completion:**
The Prior Settled Cash Report has been successfully and meticulously recreated within SSCD to match and surpass the capabilities of the Legacy Custody system. All functional elements, data flows, and report outputs have been validated and reconciled to ensure impeccable accuracy and completeness. Stakeholder review and acceptance have been obtained, and the solution is now live, with all relevant documentation delivered and archived for future reference.
