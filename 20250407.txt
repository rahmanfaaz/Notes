Got it! Here’s a revised **full email draft** that explicitly emphasizes the point that **just because the business raises a story, the team must critically assess if it should be split into multiple stories**:

**Subject:** Mandatory Adherence to Definition of Ready (DoR) & Proper Story Evaluation

Dear Team,

I hope you’re all well.

As we strengthen our delivery practices, I want to stress that **adhering to the Definition of Ready (DoR)** for all JIRA stories is **mandatory** before we move anything into a sprint.

**Importantly:** just because the business raises a story **does not mean we simply take it as-is**. It is the team’s responsibility to **carefully evaluate the scope and complexity** and determine whether the requirement should be split into **multiple, properly sized stories** to ensure clarity, manageability, and successful delivery.

Please ensure every story meets the following:

✅ **Definition of Ready (DoR) Checklist:**

* Clear and well-defined **Acceptance Criteria**
* Stated **Business Value or Justification**
* All **Dependencies and Risks** identified and addressed
* Story is **Refined, Groomed, and Estimable** by the team
* Scope assessed — **split into multiple stories if needed**
* No open questions; **Requirements fully clarified**
* Relevant **Test Scenarios and Considerations** are documented
* Any necessary designs, wireframes, or technical inputs are attached
* Team has **capacity and agreement** to commit it into the sprint
* External approvals or inputs (if needed) are secured beforehand

Let’s make this a **non-negotiable standard** in our work to uphold delivery quality, reduce rework, and set realistic expectations with our stakeholders.

Thank you all for your attention and commitment!

Best regards,
\[Your Name]

If you want, I can also draft this in a slightly sterner tone or make it more formal — just let me know the style you want!
