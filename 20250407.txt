Absolutely! Here’s a **more detailed JIRA enhancement story** with additional sections, clarity, and technical/operational depth.

### **Story Title:**

Enhance Prior Settled Cash Report to Include Backdated and Delta Transactions

---

### **Background:**

Currently, the Prior Settled Cash Report is generated using data filtered by the `DDA_DATE` (Driving Date) column. This means the report only includes trades whose `DDA_DATE` matches the report date. However, when a trade is booked or modified after the report is delivered (for example, backdated trades or late adjustments), these are not automatically captured.

**Example scenario:**

* A trade with `DDA_DATE` 2025-05-23 is booked or modified on 2025-05-26.
* The report for 2025-05-23 was already generated and delivered on 2025-05-24 at 3:00 AM EST.
* The newly booked or adjusted trade is **missed** in the original report and requires **manual regeneration**.

This gap results in incomplete reporting, operational inefficiency, and potential reconciliation issues.

---

### **Objective:**

Modify the Prior Settled Cash Report logic to automatically include **delta transactions** — i.e., backdated or adjusted trades that were missed in prior report runs — in the next day’s report.

---

### **Proposed Enhancement:**

When generating the report for a given day (e.g., 2025-05-26), the system should:
✅ Include all trades with `DDA_DATE` = 2025-05-26 (current driving date logic).
✅ Additionally, pull in any **delta trades** that were booked, modified, or adjusted between **2025-05-25 3:00 AM EST and 2025-05-26 3:00 AM EST**, even if their `DDA_DATE` is prior to the report date.

This ensures that:

* Backdated trades are automatically included in the next day’s delivery.
* Manual reruns of prior-day reports are no longer needed.
* Downstream systems receive a full and reconciled view.

---

### **Acceptance Criteria:**

✅ The report includes:

* All current-day trades (`DDA_DATE` = report date).
* All trades with prior `DDA_DATE` values that were **booked, modified, or adjusted** since the last report run.

✅ The system uses the **transaction timestamp** (e.g., `BOOKING_TIMESTAMP` or `LAST_MODIFIED_TIMESTAMP`) to identify relevant deltas.

✅ The report output clearly distinguishes:

* **Current-day transactions**.
* **Delta/backdated transactions** (possibly via a flag or separate section).

✅ All data is pulled within the defined window:

* Start: Prior day at 3:00 AM EST.
* End: Current day at 3:00 AM EST.

✅ Performance and processing time are evaluated and do not materially degrade with the expanded logic.

✅ All downstream consumers are informed of the change and understand the inclusion of backdated data.

✅ Historical reconciliation is confirmed as part of UAT to ensure no prior gaps are missed.

---

### **Technical Considerations:**

* Identify the correct system column for detecting late-booked or modified transactions.
* Ensure ETL/SQL pipelines can efficiently query across `DDA_DATE` and transaction timestamps.
* Review any report generation jobs or scheduling impacts.
* Assess data volume increases due to delta inclusion and monitor runtime.
* Update report schemas if a new flag or section is introduced to distinguish delta trades.

---

### **Operational Considerations:**

* Notify Operations teams and downstream users (e.g., reconciliations, accounting, client services) about the change.
* Provide updated documentation detailing the new report logic.
* Develop a rollback plan in case of unforeseen issues post-deployment.

---

### **JIRA Checklist:**

* [ ] Review and confirm requirements with Business and Operations stakeholders.
* [ ] Identify the correct timestamp field for delta detection.
* [ ] Update report generation logic to include delta window.
* [ ] Perform unit tests to ensure correct data inclusion.

* [ ] Validate results in UAT with real backdated scenarios.
* [ ] Update report documentation and user guides.
* [ ] Communicate changes to all impacted teams.
* [ ] Deploy to production following change management procedures.
