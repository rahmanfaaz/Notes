**Title:** Incorporate New Currency into FX Extract File â€“ EMEA Depositary Business

**Description:**
As part of the EMEA Depositary business's ongoing enhancements, we need to incorporate a newly supported currency into the existing FX extract file. This update will ensure comprehensive currency coverage and maintain alignment with operational requirements for foreign exchange reporting.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. The new currency code is added to the FX extract file generation logic.
2. All relevant mappings and transformations reflect the inclusion of the new currency.
3. Downstream systems consuming the extract recognise and process the updated format without issue.
4. Appropriate validations and reconciliation checks are updated to accommodate the new currency.
5. Regression testing is completed to confirm no impact to existing currency data.

**Notes:**

* Coordination may be required with the data governance and downstream reconciliation teams.
* The currency code and corresponding metadata will be provided separately.
