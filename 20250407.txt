### üè∑ JIRA Story

**Title:**
ICR\_DEP || Claims Engine || Database Handling Workflow Between Claims Queue / Manager

---

**Description:**
As a backend developer, I need to implement the database logic that governs how claims transition between the Claims Queue (for initial triage) and the Claims Manager (for investigation), ensuring that accepted, rejected, or reinstated claims follow the correct lifecycle stages. This includes moving data between the relevant Snowflake tables (CLAIMS\_QUEUE, CLAIMS\_MANAGER, CLAIMS\_MASTER) and maintaining audit logs, so the claims system remains consistent, traceable, and aligned with business rules.

---

**Acceptance Criteria:**
‚úÖ When a claim is accepted from the queue:

* It is deleted from CLAIMS\_QUEUE.
* A new entry is inserted into CLAIMS\_MANAGER with status `NEW`.
* CLAIMS\_MASTER is updated with status `ACCEPTED`.
* An entry is logged in CLAIMS\_QUEUE\_AUDIT recording the change.

‚úÖ When a claim is rejected from the queue:

* It is deleted from CLAIMS\_QUEUE.
* CLAIMS\_MASTER is updated with status `REJECTED`.
* An entry is logged in CLAIMS\_QUEUE\_AUDIT.

‚úÖ When a previously rejected claim is reinstated:

* It is inserted back into CLAIMS\_QUEUE with status `OUTSTANDING`.
* CLAIMS\_MASTER is updated with status `OUTSTANDING`.
* An entry is logged in CLAIMS\_QUEUE\_AUDIT.

‚úÖ All data movement:

* Is atomic (if any part fails, rollback all changes).
* Uses CEID (Claims Engine ID) as the primary reference.
* Can handle both single and multiple claim IDs.
* Captures `changed_by`, `reason`, and `timestamp` in audit records.

‚úÖ Error handling:

* Gracefully logs and reports database or transaction errors.
* Prevents partial updates.

‚úÖ Performance:

* Supports bulk actions efficiently (e.g., hundreds of claims at once).

---

**Relevant Technical Info:**

* Snowflake tables: `CLAIMS_QUEUE`, `CLAIMS_MANAGER`, `CLAIMS_MASTER`, `CLAIMS_QUEUE_AUDIT`, `CLAIMS_MANAGER_AUDIT`.
* Stored procedures involved: `proc_accept_claims`, `proc_reject_claims`, `proc_reinstate_claims`.
* Status values: OUTSTANDING, ACCEPTED, REJECTED, NEW, UNDER\_INVESTIGATION, CLOSED.
