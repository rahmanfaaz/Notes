> **Create a Unique ID for every Claim that is ingested (CEID → Claims Engine ID)**

Here’s a properly written JIRA story for this.

### 🏷 JIRA Story

**Title:**
ICR\_DEP || Claims Engine || Create a Unique ID for every Claim that is ingested (CEID → Claims Engine ID)

---

**Description:**
As a system, I need to generate a unique Claim Engine ID (CEID) every time a new claim is ingested into the system, so that each claim can be uniquely tracked across the Claims Engine lifecycle.

---

**Acceptance Criteria:**
✅ On ingest, each new claim is assigned a unique CEID (Claims Engine ID).
✅ CEID follows a defined format (e.g., ‘CLM’ + padded numeric or UUID).
✅ CEID is stored in the CLAIMS\_MASTER table.
✅ CEID is referenced consistently in CLAIMS\_QUEUE, CLAIMS\_MANAGER, and all audit tables.
✅ No duplicate CEIDs are allowed; uniqueness is guaranteed at the database level.
✅ Ingestion fails gracefully if CEID generation encounters an error.

---

**Technical Details:**

* Use `UUID_STRING()` or a Snowflake sequence to generate CEID.
* Prefix with ‘CLM’ or system-specific prefix as required.
* Incorporate CEID generation into the `proc_ingest_claim` procedure.
* Ensure downstream SPs and queries consume CEID consistently.

---

**Tasks:**
☐ Update CLAIMS\_MASTER table schema to include CEID as primary or unique key.
☐ Implement CEID generation logic in ingestion procedure.
☐ Update existing procedures and queries to use CEID instead of just raw CLAIM\_ID.
☐ Test insertion of multiple claims and confirm CEID uniqueness.
☐ Add unit tests and integration tests for CEID generation.
