### 🏷 JIRA Story

**Title:**
ICR\_DEP || Claims Engine || Source IBIS Interest Statements from Custody

---

**Description:**
As a developer, I need to implement the logic to source IBIS interest statements from the custody system so that the Claims Engine can accurately reconcile interest amounts and support downstream claims validation.

This will enable the system to pull custody interest data, integrate it into the claims processing workflow, and ensure consistency between IBIS and claims records.

---

**Acceptance Criteria:**
✅ Custody system connectivity is established (SFTP, API, or data pipeline).
✅ IBIS interest statements are successfully extracted in the required format.
✅ Data is loaded into a staging table or directly into the relevant Snowflake schema.
✅ Data mapping and field transformations are documented and applied.
✅ Historical and incremental loads are both supported (with timestamp or batch tracking).
✅ Data quality checks are implemented (e.g., completeness, validity of amounts, correct dates).
✅ Error handling is in place for failed or partial loads.
✅ The solution integrates into the overall Claims Engine pipeline and is visible to downstream processes.

**Technical Details:**

* Source: Custody system providing IBIS interest statements.
* Destination: Snowflake `CLAIMS_IBIS_INTEREST` (or similar) staging table.
* Format: Expected file type (CSV, JSON, XML) or API response format.
* Frequency: Define (daily, weekly, monthly) based on business needs.
* Fields: Include principal, interest, currency, date range, account identifiers.

**Tasks:**
☐ Confirm custody data access method and credentials.
☐ Develop extraction pipeline or script.
☐ Create and deploy staging table/schema in Snowflake.
☐ Build transformation and mapping logic.
☐ Conduct sample loads and validate outputs.
☐ Write integration tests and define monitoring/alerts.
☐ Document the solution for operations and support.
