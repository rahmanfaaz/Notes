**Subject:** Mandatory Adherence to Definition of Ready (DoR) & Rigorous Story Evaluation

Dear Team,

I trust this message finds you well.

As we continue to elevate the standards of our delivery practices, I wish to emphasise that **strict adherence to the Definition of Ready (DoR)** is imperative before any JIRA story is accepted into a sprint.

**It is essential to understand** that the mere submission of a story by the business **does not necessitate its acceptance in its current form**. It is incumbent upon the team to **critically assess the scope and complexity**, determining whether the requirement ought to be **decomposed into multiple, well-defined stories** to ensure clarity, manageability, and successful delivery.

Please ensure each story satisfies the following criteria:

✅ **Definition of Ready (DoR) Checklist:**

* Clearly articulated and mutually agreed **Acceptance Criteria**
* Explicitly stated **Business Value or Justification**
* All **Dependencies and Risks** identified, documented, and where possible, resolved
* Story is **Refined, Groomed, and Estimable** by the delivery team
* Scope thoroughly evaluated — **segmented into multiple stories if warranted**
* Absence of open questions; **Requirements and Scope fully clarified**
* Relevant **Test Scenarios and Considerations** meticulously outlined
* Required designs, wireframes, or technical details are readily available (if applicable)
* Team has the requisite **capacity and consensus** to commit to the sprint
* Any external approvals or inputs have been duly secured in advance

Let us collectively uphold these non-negotiable standards to preserve delivery excellence, mitigate the risk of rework, and maintain the trust of our stakeholders.

Thank you all for your unwavering commitment and dedication.

Warm regards,
\[Your Name]

If you’d like, I can also prepare this as a formal document attachment or draft a version for leadership circulation. Shall I prepare that?
