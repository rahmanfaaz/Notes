Hereâ€™s your clean JIRA story draft:

**Story Title:**
Set Up Entitlements for Fund Management via ESF for ITA, LUX, NLD, and IRE

---

**Description:**
This story focuses on configuring entitlements for the funds used within the application by integrating with the ESF system. The implementation will cover four countries: Italy (ITA), Luxembourg (LUX), Netherlands (NLD), and Ireland (IRE). This setup will enable the business teams to independently maintain and manage their fund lists using EDG and MDG, improving operational flexibility and reducing dependency on technical teams.

---

**Acceptance Criteria:**

* Identify and document the specific fund entitlements required for ITA, LUX, NLD, and IRE
* Configure ESF to handle entitlement setups for each of the four countries
* Ensure integration points with EDG and MDG are properly established for seamless fund list management
* Conduct testing to verify correct entitlement setup and business self-service functionality
* Implement error handling and provide appropriate access controls and audit trails
* Finalise and deliver documentation detailing entitlement configurations, country-specific setups, and operational instructions for business users

**Comment upon Successful Completion:**
The entitlement setup for funds via ESF has been successfully implemented for ITA, LUX, NLD, and IRE. Integration with EDG and MDG is complete, allowing business teams to manage their fund lists independently. All configurations have been tested and documented, and the solution is now live and operational.
