Hereâ€™s the clean, professional JIRA story draft for that:

---

**Story Title:**
Implement TNA Data Fetch from MDB and Delivery via MFX for Closed Funds

---

**Description:**
This story focuses on setting up the data integration to fetch Total Net Assets (TNA) data from the MDB application. Whenever a fund is marked as closed, the corresponding TNA data should be extracted from MDB and securely transmitted to the destination system using the MFX interface. This ensures accurate and timely delivery of TNA figures for closed funds, supporting downstream processes and reporting.

---

**Acceptance Criteria:**

* Identify and document the specific TNA data points required from MDB for closed funds
* Develop and implement a mechanism to extract TNA data from MDB upon fund closure
* Ensure the extracted data is formatted according to MFX transmission requirements
* Configure the MFX interface to securely deliver the TNA data to the destination system
* Conduct end-to-end testing to verify accurate extraction, formatting, and delivery of TNA data
* Implement error handling and alerting mechanisms for any extraction or transmission failures
* Complete documentation of the integration process, including mappings, scheduling, and troubleshooting guidelines

---

**Comment upon Successful Completion:**
The integration for fetching TNA data from MDB and delivering it via MFX for closed funds has been successfully implemented. The solution has been tested end-to-end, ensuring accurate data extraction, proper formatting, and secure delivery. All documentation has been completed, and the process is now fully operational.
