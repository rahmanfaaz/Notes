Create CLAIMS_SUPPLEMENTAL_PROPERTIES Table for UI and Backend Static Data

As a developer,
I want to create a centralized Snowflake table named CLAIMS_SUPPLEMENTAL_PROPERTIES,
So that all static configuration and reference data (such as dropdowns, brokers, status lists) used by the UI and backend are stored and maintained consistently.

Snowflake table CLAIMS_SUPPLEMENTAL_PROPERTIES is created in the appropriate schema.

Table includes fields for logical grouping, static value storage, optional display/description, and metadata for tracking.

Initial reference data is inserted as per UI/backend needs.

Table access is verified and test queries are validated for UI/backend components.

Data model is reviewed and approved by technical leads.

Table structure includes fields for type, name, value, description, and tracking metadata.

Supports UI and backend lookup needs through a flexible schema.

Initial sample records are inserted (e.g., claim statuses, broker list).

Structure reviewed and approved by data engineering lead.

Data access tested by both frontend and backend applications.
