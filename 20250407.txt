Thank you for the clarification! Here’s the corrected and polished JIRA story reflecting **WM11** (instead of WM1):

**Story Title:**
ICR\_NGC || Depositaries EMEA || Recreate the FX Rates Report for WM11, Currently Generated from FDR

---

**Description:**
This story involves the full redevelopment of the FX Rates Report for WM11 within the ICR\_NGC system, which is presently sourced and generated via the FDR platform. The objective is to replicate and enhance this report within ICR\_NGC, ensuring it meets all current business, data, and compliance requirements while providing improved system efficiency, maintainability, and reporting accuracy.

This initiative plays a vital role in reducing reliance on legacy systems, thereby strengthening the robustness and resilience of the EMEA Depositaries reporting suite and supporting future scalability.
