**Story Title:**
ICR\_NGC || Depositaries EMEA || Enhancement of FX Rates Report to Pick Up Data for Multiple Dates

---

**Description:**
This story focuses on enhancing the FX Rates Report within the ICR\_NGC system under the EMEA Depositaries project. Currently, the report is limited in scope and only retrieves data for a single date. The objective is to modify the report logic to allow retrieval of FX rate data across multiple dates, improving its utility for analysis, reconciliation, and reporting purposes.

---

**Acceptance Criteria:**

* Analyse and document the current FX Rates Report design and date selection mechanism
* Update the report logic to support data extraction for multiple specified dates
* Ensure that the report output is properly structured and displays multi-date data clearly and accurately
* Conduct validation tests to confirm that data for all selected dates is being correctly retrieved and presented
* Perform regression testing to ensure no impact on other report functionalities or downstream processes
* Finalise documentation outlining the enhancement, including configuration changes, testing results, and usage guidelines

**Comment upon Successful Completion:**
The enhancement to the FX Rates Report has been successfully implemented, enabling the report to pick up data for multiple dates. All changes have been tested and validated, ensuring accurate multi-date data retrieval without impacting existing functionalities. The enhancement is now live and operational, with updated documentation provided to stakeholders.
