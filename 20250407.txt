1. What Veracode Supports

Veracode’s static analysis engine for Oracle can only parse PL/SQL program units. These include:

CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE …

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION …

CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE …

CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE BODY …

CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER …

These contain procedural logic, which is where Veracode detects security flaws (e.g., SQL injection, insecure dynamic SQL, privilege misuse).

2. What Veracode Does Not Support

Veracode does not support scanning:

SQL*Plus directives (e.g., SET SQLBLANKLINES ON, SPOOL, /)

DDL (Data Definition Language) such as:

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW …

CREATE TABLE …

CREATE TYPE …

Standalone DML scripts (e.g., INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE outside of PL/SQL code)

These are rejected because Veracode’s parser is not a general SQL engine — it only looks at PL/SQL program code.

3. What Happened in Our Scan

We included .vw.sql files (which contain view definitions) and SQL*Plus directives (SET SQLBLANKLINES ON;).

Veracode attempted to parse these as PL/SQL but failed, reporting errors such as:

“extraneous input TYPE expecting {BULK, FROM, INTO, ‘;’}”

“Too many parse failures. 0% of files successfully parsed.”

Because the success rate dropped below the required threshold, the scan aborted with a fatal error.

4. How to Fix This (Mitigation)

Do include in the Veracode package:

.prc, .fnc, .pks, .pkb, .pls, .trg files containing valid PL/SQL program units.

Do not include in the Veracode package:

.vw.sql files with CREATE VIEW …

Any DDL or SQL*Plus commands

Pure DML scripts

For views and DDL:

These must be reviewed with a different tool (e.g., SonarQube with PL/SQL plugin, PFCLCode, or Oracle SQLcl linting).

Keep them in version control and deployment, but exclude them from Veracode uploads.

5. Developer Action Items

Separate PL/SQL program code from SQL DDL/DML scripts.

Package only PL/SQL program files for Veracode scans.

Use complementary tools for DDL/SQL review.

Update build scripts (zip, upload) so .vw.sql and other unsupported files are filtered out automatically.
