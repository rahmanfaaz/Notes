Here’s the clean JIRA story draft for this:

---

**Story Title:**
Extend Mediator for Swift Messages from inCash to All Countries

---

**Description:**
This story involves enhancing the existing mediator process that retrieves Swift messages from the inCash application. Currently, the setup is functional only for Italy (ITA). The objective is to extend this mediator so it can handle and process Swift messages for all applicable countries, ensuring consistent and scalable message flow across regions.

---

**Acceptance Criteria:**

* Review and document the current mediator setup handling Swift messages from inCash for ITA
* Identify all additional countries to be included in the extended scope
* Update the mediator logic to support message retrieval and handling for all target countries
* Ensure country-specific configurations, if any, are applied within the extended setup
* Conduct end-to-end testing to validate Swift message retrieval, processing, and delivery for each country
* Implement robust error handling and alerting mechanisms across the expanded scope
* Update and finalise documentation, including updated country lists, configurations, and operational guidelines

---

**Comment upon Successful Completion:**
The mediator for Swift messages from inCash has been successfully extended to cover all countries beyond ITA. The solution has been fully tested, verified, and documented, ensuring reliable and scalable message processing across the expanded regional footprint. The system is now live and operational for all targeted countries.

Let me know if you’d like me to list **which specific countries** to include or draft **subtasks per country or per configuration area**!
