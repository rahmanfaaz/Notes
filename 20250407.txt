**Title:**
Update Metadata Variables and Helm Chart for EMEA Depositary Extracts – Auth Failure Fix

**Description:**
The initial run of extracts for the **EMEA Depositary Business** is consistently failing due to **authentication errors**. Although retransmission succeeds, the core issue in the initial run needs to be resolved.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

* [ ] Update the relevant **metadata variables** as per the fix provided by the Core Team.
* [ ] Apply the necessary changes to the **Helm chart values/configuration**.
* [ ] Deploy the updated Helm chart to the appropriate environment(s).
* [ ] Validate that the **initial run of EMEA Depositary extracts completes successfully** without authentication failure.
* [ ] Ensure retransmission process remains unaffected.
* [ ] Update documentation or configuration repositories as needed.

**Notes:**

* Fix details and values to be updated are available in the shared documentation or JIRA linked by the Core Team.
* Coordination with the DevOps team may be required for Helm deployment.
