Hi Chanda,

Thank you for checking.

The report is generated based on commit metadata extracted from our Git repository — specifically from the commit messages and merge comments.
We follow a structured convention where every developer includes the JIRA ID in the commit or merge message using the -m flag.

For example:

git commit -m "AC-483477: Deposits Auto Trigger Table pull"


or for merges:

git merge Release_QA -m "Merge branch 'Release_QA' into 'Release_QA_Feature' - AC-483477: Deposits Auto Trigger Table"


The script/report then parses the repository logs (via git log or API) and extracts JIRA IDs using a regex pattern like:

(AC|TO|ICR|BUG)-[0-9]{3,6}


So as long as everyone consistently adds the JIRA ID in their commit or merge messages, these details automatically appear in the report without any manual tagging.

We can standardize this approach across the team to maintain consistent traceability between Git commits and JIRA stories.
