**Title:** Add "Country Code" Column to Prior Settled CSH Extract File

**Description:**
To enable more robust country-level reporting and facilitate future scalability, a new column titled **"Country Code"** is to be added to the Prior Settled CSH extract file. Although the current dataset comprises records for funds domiciled in a single country, this enhancement will introduce flexibility for multi-country support. The country code will follow standard three-letter representations (e.g., *ITA* for Italy).

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. A new column named **"Country Code"** is introduced to the Prior Settled CSH extract file.
2. The column is populated using standard ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 codes (e.g., *ITA*, *GBR*, *DEU*).
3. All existing records are backfilled with the appropriate code for the relevant country.
4. The extract layout is updated while maintaining backward compatibility for downstream systems.
5. Successful completion of regression testing and validation to ensure data accuracy and structural integrity.

**Notes:**

* Initial values (e.g., *ITA* for Italy) will be provided by the business team based on current fund mappings.
* Relevant documentation and technical specifications must be updated to reflect this schema change.
